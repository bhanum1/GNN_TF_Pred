# Thermal_Fluid_Prediction_GNN
Collection of my work during Summer 2024 for the AI4ChemS Lab at the University of Toronto.

See the chemprop_commands.txt file for the commands to put into the CLI to run chemprop networks.

Chemprop can be installed via "$pip install chempropt"

Config files contain all the specifications needed, but path files will need to be changed based on user's file setup.

.pt files containing weights of the best models are included in the model folders, as well as predictions and training curve data.
